FileSharingApp v1.0.12 - Junior Developer Guide (Simple English)
====================================================================

1. Story
--------
You have a big ZIP file.
You want to send it safely and see what happens.
This app does not upload to real servers by default.
It shows you how a real app WOULD be built,
using clean Java, web UI, tests, and logs.

2. Main Ideas (Very Simple)
---------------------------

(Blue) Java Classes
- A class is a file that groups related code.
- Example: WebLauncher is a class that starts a tiny web server.
- Example: LoggerUtil is a class that prints messages.

(Green) Interfaces (we keep it small here)
- We could create TransferMethod interface later for HTTP/S3/ZeroTier.
- Idea: An interface says "any class that implements me must have this method."

(Orange) Helpers
- LoggerUtil: one simple place to log messages.
- AppConfig: reads configuration from application.properties.
- NetworkUtil: checks IP and ports.
- ValidationUtil: checks if zip file and port number look safe.

(Purple) Web UI
- WebLauncher uses Java's built-in HttpServer.
- It serves index.html on http://localhost:8080.
- index.html is where user types:
  - Name
  - Role (Sender/Receiver)
  - Mode (HTTP/ZeroTier/S3)
  - Paths and IPs.
- JavaScript in index.html shows friendly messages.
- Later you can connect the form to /send-http API to trigger real transfers.

3. Testing (Dark Green)
-----------------------
- We use TestNG so we can run tests easily in IntelliJ.
- LaunchWebUITest:
  - Starts the Web UI so QA can see it.
- CucumberTestRunner:
  - Runs feature files written in near-English.
- CucumberSteps:
  - Links English steps to small Java methods.

Example:
- Feature line: "Given the File Sharing App is ready"
- Java method: appReady() sets a boolean flag.

4. Cloud & Security Concepts (AWS Friendly)
-------------------------------------------
- application.properties holds:
  - aws.s3.bucket
  - aws.s3.region
- We DO NOT put access keys in code.
- In real AWS:
  - We would use IAM Role or local AWS profile.
- This matches AWS Cloud Practitioner ideas:
  - Shared Responsibility
  - IAM for permissions
  - S3 for storage
  - No secrets in source.

5. How to Read the Code
-----------------------
Start with these:

1) WebLauncher.java
   - See how we start HttpServer.
   - See how we load index.html.
   - See how we open the browser.

2) index.html
   - Read the labels and inputs.
   - See how JavaScript builds a friendly status message.

3) LoggerUtil.java
   - Very small.
   - Shows you how to wrap logging so other classes stay clean.

4) NetworkUtil.java and ValidationUtil.java
   - Simple checks.
   - Good place to practice adding more rules.

6. Why this project is good for practice
----------------------------------------
- Everything is short and readable.
- Every class has comments in clear English.
- No hidden magic or heavy frameworks.
- You can extend it:
  - Add real transfer code.
  - Add Selenium tests for the HTML page.
  - Add more Cucumber scenarios.
  - Add AWS S3 upload using IAM role when you are ready.

If you can understand WebLauncher + index.html + LoggerUtil,
you already understand most real-world micro-tools.
